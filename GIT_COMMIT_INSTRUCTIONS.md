## Important Notes

- Your API key is in `SETUP.md` but **NOT** in `.env.local` (which is gitignored)
- Make sure `.env.local` is not committed (it's in `.gitignore`)
- For Railway deployment, add the API key as an environment variable in the Railway dashboard

## API Key for Railway

When deploying to Railway, use this API key as an environment variable:
```
VENICE_API_KEY=Qw553Q96e7bauOdtJXnbGLRBUAqQEwxBQiBLRD7RKj
```
